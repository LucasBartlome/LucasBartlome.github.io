      <h2>Project 1: AI Podcast Generator</h2>
      <p>
        Worked with a team at Motivation Technology to create an AI-based Podcast Generator prototype loosely based on Google’s NotebookLM project. The 
        project used Python within a VS Code environment, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT and TTS (Text to Speech) API call to create the 
        Podcast scripts. A simple UI was created to allow granular control of the parameters used to create podcasts (e.g. Title and 
        Episode, names of hosts, voices used). The output was an MP3 file that could be played in a simple web-based player. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenAI GPT and Text-to-Speech APIs</li>
        <li>Python and Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>Use AI to create podcast script using GPT APIs and Outputs in JSON format</li>
        <li>Took advantage of OpenAIs TTS to create mp3 fragments</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">The GUI when the podcast generator is opened allowing you to select a project folder</h1>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">This is the main menu GUI Where you are able to select all of the variables of your podcast
        such as The name of you podcast, the voices of the hosts, and the style of podcast(Serious, Funny, etc.) here is also where you decide what you want the topic of
        your podcast to be! </h1>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">When choosing your podcast topic you have a couple of options, you can easily enter
        a prompt (shown below), or you can enter a file that OpenAIs GPT will scrape and attempt to find the most important
        information (shown above), Or you can even enter a website URL that will get scraped and use that information
        as the podcast topic. </h1>

      <h2>Project 2: Fishing Game (Python)</h2>
      <p>
        I created a 2D fishing game using Python in Visual Studio Code. 
        This project taught me about game loops, sprite handling, and user input in Python.
        The game allows the player to cast a line, catch different fish, and see them appear next to the fisherman. 
        I also implemented scaling logic so fish size reflects their weight.

      <h2>Project 3: Database In MySQL</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborated on a team project to design and implement a database in MySQL for a test company called Phoenix Corp. The goal was to track all employees and products in a simulated store environment in order to identify meaningful patterns within the data.

      We started by designing an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to map out the structure of the database, which included roughly 10 entities. Two of these sets were modeled using inheritance—one for different employee types and another for different product types. Using the ERD as a guide, we built the database schema and populated it with realistic testing data.

      To demonstrate the value of the system, we developed 15 SQL queries that incorporated joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and more to extract insights and highlight specific business cases within the data. This experience strengthened my skills in relational database design and advanced query writing, while also giving me valuable perspective on how businesses leverage databases to analyze operations and drive data-driven decisions.
