      <h2>Project 1: AI Podcast Generator</h2>
      <p>
        Worked with a team at Motivation Technology to create an AI-based Podcast Generator prototype loosely based on Google’s NotebookLM project. The 
        project used Python within a VS Code environment, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT and TTS (Text to Speech) API call to create the 
        Podcast scripts. A simple UI was created to allow granular control of the parameters used to create podcasts (e.g. Title and 
        Episode, names of hosts, voices used). The output was an MP3 file that could be played in a simple web-based player. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenAI GPT and Text-to-Speech APIs</li>
        <li>Python and Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>Use AI to create podcast script using GPT APIs and Outputs in JSON format</li>
        <li>Took advantage of OpenAIs TTS to create mp3 fragments</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">This is the main menu GUI Where you are able to select all of the variables of your podcast
        such as The name of you podcast, the voices of the hosts, and the style of podcast(Serious, Funny, etc.) here is also where you decide what you want the topic of
        your podcast to be! </h1>

      <img src="images/Podcast2.png" alt="Podcast Screenshot 2" style="width:70%; height:auto;">
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">When Choosing your podcast topic you have a couple of options, you can easily enter
        a prompt(shown below), or you can enter a file that OpenAIs GPT will scrape and attempt to find the most important
        information(Shown Above), Or you can even enter a website URL that will get scraped and use that information
        as the podcast topic. </h1>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">After running the program it gives you an MP3 File of your fully completed AI generated Podcast!</h1>

      <h2>Project 2: Fishing Game (Python)</h2>
      <p>
        I created a 2D fishing game using Python in Visual Studio Code. 
        This project taught me about game loops, sprite handling, and user input in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game allows the player to cast a line, catch different fish, and see them appear next to the fisherman. 
        I also implemented scaling logic so fish size reflects their weight.
      </p>

      <h2>Project 3: DataBase In MySQL</h2>
      <p>
        I lead a group in which we created a database in mysql for a fake company we called phoenix corp to keep track of
        all employees and products through their store to identify patterns and keep track of all of their information.
        We had roughly 10 entities that were used including 2 sets of inherited entities for employee type as well as 
        for product type. We then created an entity relationship diagram to help us to create the database itself as well
        as get a better idea of how it can be used it in the long run. We then populated the database with fake information
        and created 15 different queries in MySQL using a combination of left and right joins to find specific instances
        and cases within our data that we made. I really enjoyed this project because it gave us an insight into how a 
        company would use a database and writing useful SQL queries.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">This is the Relational Diagram we created for our database</h1>
